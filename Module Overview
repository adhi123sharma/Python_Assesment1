Under the programming module we learnt a lot of the basics of programming starting from just presenting the name on the console to presenting numbers/data/points on an image.
We started with introduction to what python is and what prgramming in python is, then understood the use of GitHub and how to upload our codes on github, Then in the Lectures/Practicals
started with understanding variables which helped us to form the agent based modelling which helped us create the basic of code, in which later we applied containers to it which helped
us to shrink the long codes that we created so that they could be easier to interpret, while shriking the codes we also created some branches and loops which helped us to get an 
imagery or point outputs.Later we started building tools which had different fucntions givng us different results.Agents parts were the classes that we created together simplified 
and ran the code together from different classes and parts, I/O and communication helped us to understand in detail about the visual representaion of the codes we made and data we added
.Finally the animation of the data and points on the image showed that how we could move the points and data connected together to affect each other.
